## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Starbuck Rewards APP user data to better understand:
1.The profile (eg.gender,age,income)of users who completed the offers after being influenced by the APP push
2.Do the features of these completed users vary by different APP push mechanisms?
3.Do the time intervals between offer received and offer completed vary by user features and push mechanism?
4.What are the features of active customers?
5.What are the probabilities to complete offers between customers with different age and income?
6.What are the difference of revenue per person between active customers,influenced customers,and uninfluenced customers
7.What are the channels for unviewed pushes?
