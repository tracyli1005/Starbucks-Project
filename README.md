This Jupyter Notebook analyzes Starbucks promotional campaigns using mobile app data, and builds predictive models to identify high-conversion customer segments. The analysis integrates transaction logs, demographic data, and offer metadata to optimize promotional ROI.

## üìã Project Overview
&zwnj;**Objective**&zwnj;:  
Identify customer segments with highest promotion conversion rates (BOGO/Discount/Info) and build predictive models with >80% precision.

&zwnj;**Datasets**&zwnj;:
- `portfolio.json`: Offer details (type/duration/channels)
- `profile.json`: 17k customer demographics (age/gender/income)
- `transcript.json`: 306k event records (offer received/viewed/completed)

---

## üîç Key Analysis Steps

### 1. Advanced Data Cleaning
- üßπ Unified column names (`id`‚Üí`offer_id`, `person`‚Üí`user_id`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cleaned anomalies: 
  - Removed customers with missing gender/income 
  - Filtered implausible ages (e.g. 118 years old)
- üïí Standardized time units (hours ‚Üí days)
- üß© Extracted nested JSON data from transaction logs

- ‚úÖ &zwnj;**User-Offer Alignment**&zwnj;:  
  Used forward-filling on transaction timestamps to assign the closest offer ID to user transactions  
- üß© &zwnj;**User Behavior Classification**&zwnj;:
  | Group | Behavior Pattern | Impact Level |
  |-------|-------------------|--------------|
  | 1Ô∏è‚É£    | Received ‚Üí Viewed ‚Üí Transacted ‚Üí Completed | Valid Conversion |
  | 2Ô∏è‚É£    | Received ‚Üí Viewed | Invalid Promotion |
  | 3Ô∏è‚É£    | Transacted Without Offer Exposure | Natural Behavior |
  | 4Ô∏è‚É£    | Received Only | No Engagement |

### 2. User Segmentation
| Group | Description | Size |
|-------|-------------|------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£    | Viewed & Redeemed | 62,824 | 
| 2Ô∏è‚É£    | Viewed & Not Redeemed | 32,107 |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£    | Transactions Without Offers | 138,953 |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£    | Received & Ignored | 72,116 |

### 3. Predictive Modeling
&zwnj;**Model Selection**&zwnj;:
- KNN / Decision Tree / Random Forest
- &zwnj;**Optimization**&zwnj;: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

&zwnj;**Performance (Precision)**&zwnj;:
| Offer Type | Best Model | Precision | Key Features |
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| BOGO      | Decision Tree | 83.6%    | Membership Tenure, Income |
| Discount  | Random Forest | 89.0%    | Age, Transaction Frequency |
| Info      | Random Forest | 85.0%    | Gender, Offer View Rate |
